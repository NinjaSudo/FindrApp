## User Stories

### Required:
#### Search Results Page
* [ ] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
* [ ] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
* [ ] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

#### Filter page
##### (Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API)

* [ ] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
* [ ] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
* [ ] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states. Optional: implement a custom switch
* [ ] Radius filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
* [ ]Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is here: http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list
* [ ] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.

### Optional:
* [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
* [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.
